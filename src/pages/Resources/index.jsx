                            <h3>Overview</h3>
                            <p>
                                Online resources play a crucial role in the world of web development, serving as
                                invaluable assets to developers at all skill levels. They offer a vast repository of
                                knowledge, tutorials, documentation, and code samples that can be accessed anytime,
                                anywhere. They offer solutions to common coding challenges, facilitate troubleshooting,
                                and provide guidance on implementation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Online communities and forums also foster collaboration and enable developers to connect
                                with peers, seek advice, and share their expertise. Overall, online resources empower
                                web developers to enhance their skills, stay current, overcome obstacles, and
                                continually expand their horizons.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Knowing which resources are reliable and easily digestible is the most important skill a
                                software developer can have. No one can or really needs to store all the nuanced
                                semantics of programming in their heads and this is thanks to online resources.
                            </p>

                                On this page I will highlight my personal go-to resources. Feel free to explore and come
                                to these for help with upcoming projects
                            </p>
                            <div>

                                <p>
                                    It is super important to remember that being able to use these resources hinges
                                    entirely on your ability to ask google or the stack overflow search what you are
                                    looking for. Googling is a skill that you majorly have to develop to be a successful
                                    programmer.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The most important this for searching for how to fix an error in your code is to
                                    understand the error (and your code) well enough to know the correct key words to
                                    enter in the search.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Lastly, pro tip is when stuck with debugging javascript, just copy pasting error
                                    codes into google will usually yield decent result.
                                </p>

                            <h4>Stack Overflow</h4>
                            <p>
                                Website Link: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow.com</a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Stack Overflow is an essential platform for developers. It offers a vast repository of
                                questions and answers contributed by the community, providing valuable insights,
                                solutions, and explanations.The collaborative nature of the platform encourages
                                knowledge sharing and community engagement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I frequently visit stack overflow and look at previously asked questions for debugging
                                and it is probably one of the best resources on the web. For example, in the process of
                                programming this webpage I have visited stack overflow for troubleshooting and code
                                samples multiple times. (If you have an error in your code I can almost guarantee
                                someone else has had the same issue and asked about it on stack)
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div className="contain-fluid" id="mdn">
                            <hr />

                            <h4>MDN Web Docs</h4>
                            <p>
                                Website Link: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">developer.mozilla.org</a>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) is an very powerful resource for developers, providing a
                                wide range of use cases. Developers frequently rely on MDN as a reference for syntax,
                                usage examples, and browser compatibility details.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I will frequently go to MDN for instructions on how to use certain tags or write certain
                                pieces of code pretty frequently. But to be honest it best suited for new developers
                                looking to learn the language.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div className="contain-fluid" id="w3">
                            <hr />

                            <h4>W3Schools</h4>
                            <p>
                                Website Link: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.com/</a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                W3Schools caters to developers of all levels by offering comprehensive tutorials, a vast
                                code snippet library, interactive coding exercises, and a collaborative community. It
                                serves as an invaluable resource for learning, practicing, and sharing knowledge,
                                empowering developers to grow and excel in their web development journey.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I personally find the W3 is super helpful when learning new code. It is definitely
                                catering towards newer developers and it is simple and helpful and has some code IDE's
                                that let you experiment with the stuff your are learning.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I would just be a bit wary because occasionally W3 is just incorrect about some things
                                so if you try their instructions and it doesn't work don't be too disappointed.

                            <p>
                                Free Code Camp and Coursera are both great leaning resources, I did not include them
                                above because they are not so much a tool for development as a full courses for in depth
                                learning. Just searching within them and looking for courses that you like is a great
                                way to start.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have personally heard great things about just the basic
                                <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-full-stack-cloud-developer">
                                    IBM Full Stack Software Developer Course
                                </a>
                                at coursera. This one will go well beyond what we cover in this course and allow for the
                                integration of a back end with the front end we will learn to program here.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The freeCodeCamp ones are also very good and they have numerous courses in various
                                programming languages. Just create an account if you are interested in their content and
                                chose something you find interesting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lastly, there are so many free courses it is hard to justify the inclusion of a paid one
                                but nonetheless, this is the course that I took and it was fantastic. I took it into
                                various professional environments and it worked fantastically. I will link it
                                <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">here</a> for those
                                who are interested.

                                PS: if you are going to buy it, wait for it to go on sale. It happens pretty often and
                                it gets cut from that $200 price to something more affordable like right now it is at
                                $34.s
